Course **exercises** will consist of incomplete notebooks that you will complete on your own (you may ask others / myself for hints if you get stumped). \n",

For example, in the first code cell below, you will see that the csv library has already been imported for you; there is no `TODO` above the `import` line. However, the `TODO` two lines below specifies that you will need to complete the code to import each collision table using the [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) library."
