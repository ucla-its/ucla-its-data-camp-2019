## Day 1
#### Overview
We are going to dive right into programming in Python with a focus on getting data and writing it out to disk. From the Pre-Course Activity, you should be comfortable loading CSV data and grabbing OpenStreetMap data from the `osmnx` package. Today we are going to look at getting data from APIs, which are becoming much more commonly used to acquire data. The exercise will be using some skills that you should be familiar with now: creating lists and looping through them, accessing dictionary key/value pairs, and writing basic functions.
